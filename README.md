Welcome to our site designer lite! You can build a site with this tool using "blocks". Just select where you want to add your block on the page and the type of block you want to add.

## Feature Request

We have two feature requests:

1. Add a new block that is just a text block that allows the user to add  text to the page.
2. Add a new preview mode that users can toggle that removes the sidebar and makes editable fields no longer editable.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Testing

You can run the tests using

```bash
npm test
```
